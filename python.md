A python client API for Sysdig Cloud. Available on Github at https://github.com/draios/python-sdc-client.

This module is a wrapper around the Sysdig Cloud API, which is documented [here](rest_api). It exposes most of the sysdig REST API functionality as an easy to use and easy to install python interface. The repository includes a rich set of examples (in the [examples](https://github.com/draios/python-sdc-client/tree/master/examples) subdir) that quickly address several use cases.
